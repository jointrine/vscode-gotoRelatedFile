# goto-related-file README

This is the README for your extension "goto-related-file". After writing up a brief description, we recommend including the following sections.

## Features

This extension provides quick navigation between files that are related through the name. 

## Usage

Open the command palette and enter `Go to Related File`.

You can also add a keyboard shortcut to the command `gotoRelatedFile.goToRelated` (I like `Cmd+Alt+P` :))

## Release Notes

### 0.1.0

Initial release with support to navigate to sibling files with different extension. 
If more than one such file exists, you get a quickpick to choose which one to open.
